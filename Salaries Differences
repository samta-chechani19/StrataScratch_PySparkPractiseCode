ID 10308 : Salaries Differences

Write a query that calculates the difference between the highest salaries found in the marketing and engineering departments. Output just the absolute difference in salaries.
Tables: db_employee, db_dept
db_employee
id:intfirst_name:varcharlast_name:varcharsalary:intdepartment_id:int
db_dept
id:intdepartment:varchar

My Solution :
# Import your libraries
import pyspark
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

# Start writing code
df = db_employee.join(db_dept,db_employee.department_id==db_dept.id,"inner")

df1 = df.select(((max(when(col("department")=="marketing",col("salary"))))-(max(when(col("department")=="engineering",col("salary"))))).alias("salary_difference"))

#df1.show()

# To validate your solution, convert your final pySpark df to a pandas df
df1.toPandas()

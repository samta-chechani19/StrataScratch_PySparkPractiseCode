Q Id 10353 -> Workers With The Highest Salaries

You have been asked to find the job titles of the highest-paid employees.

Your output should include the highest-paid title or multiple titles with the same salary.
Tables: worker, title

worker
worker_id:intfirst_name:varcharlast_name:varcharsalary:intjoining_date:datetimedepartment:varchar
title
worker_ref_id:intworker_title:varcharaffected_from:datetime

My Solution :
# Import your libraries
import pyspark
from pyspark.sql.functions import *
from pyspark.sql.window import Window

# Start writing code
worker_df = worker.join(title,worker.worker_id==title.worker_ref_id,"inner")

window_spec = Window.orderBy(col("salary").desc())
df2 = worker_df.withColumn("Rn",dense_rank().over(window_spec)).filter(col("Rn")==1).select("worker_title")

df2.show()
# To validate your solution, convert your final pySpark df to a pandas df
df2.toPandas()
